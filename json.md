# JSON & Python

## JSON

[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](http://json.org/), specified by [RFC 7159]() (which obsoletes RFC 4627) and by ECMA-404, is a `lightweight data interchange` format inspired by [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) object literal syntax (although it is not a strict subset of JavaScript).

### `JSON` is built on `two` structures:

* 1 A collection of `name/value` pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an `object`, `record`, `struct`, `dictionary`, `hash table`, `keyed list`, or `associative array`.


* An **ordered** `list` of values. In most languages, this is realized as an `array`, `vector`, `list`, or `sequence`.

###  In `JSON`, they take on these `forms`:

**1** An **object** is an `unordered` **set** of `name/value` pairs.

* An `object` begins with `{` (left brace) and ends with `}` (right brace).

* Each `name` is followed by `:` (colon) 

* The `name/value` pairs are `separated` by `, `(comma)

**2** An `array` is an `ordered` collection of **values**. 

* An array begins with `[` (left bracket) and ends with `]` (right bracket).

* Values are separated by `,` (comma).

**3** A `value` can be a `string` in double quotes, or a `number`, or `true` or `false` or `null`, or an `object` or an `array`. 

These structures can be `nested`.

**4** A **string** is a sequence of zero or more `Unicode` characters, wrapped in `double` quotes(`"`), using backslash escapes(`\`). 

A `character` is represented as a single character `string`. 

A string is very much like a `C` or `Java` string.

**5** A `number` is very much like a `C` or `Java` number, `except` that the `octal and hexadecimal` formats are not used.

## Example: the json file of Rankine81 object in step4-json: **rankine81.json**
